# Salary Prediction using Linear and Polynomial Regression

This project demonstrates the use of both Linear and Polynomial Regression models to predict salaries based on the position level of employees. By using a dataset that contains position levels and their corresponding salaries, this project showcases the differences between linear and polynomial models in fitting data and making predictions.

## Detailed Summary

The script starts by importing a dataset containing employee position levels and their salaries. It implements both **Linear Regression** and **Polynomial Regression** models to predict salaries based on position level. The project compares the performance of the two models by visualizing their results, highlighting how polynomial regression can provide a more flexible and accurate fit for non-linear data.
